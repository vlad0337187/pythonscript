Switch is just a pattern matching construct.  Javascript/coffeescript have a pretty mediocre version of it, so in my opinion, Python lacking it at all is better than having a halfway useful feature.

Now, if it could match on ranges, conditional checks, the type of the param (is_instance), or the return value of a function, instead of just whatever specific value it has, then it'd be more useful.  But as is, it is rarely useful even in javascript.
