tasks:
	+ write scanner package:
		+ write list of tokens, token class
		+ write scanner (take it from CPython and adapt)
	+ write parser package:
		+ write main parser class
		- add possibility to build in Python code
	- corrections 1:
		- write module with normal regular expressions ({start}{[a-b], +}{numbers, 2}{end})
			It must use standard python regex module as backend:
				- add function: autotranslate - automatically translating
					from "bad" regular expressions (module re)
					to ours ones
				- translating and executing our regular expressions to
					"bad" ones (module re)
		- rewrite scanner to use that module with normal regular expressions
		- add ability for scanner to scan multiline comments (starting from "###", ending with "###")
	- add possibility to launch PythonScript scripts directly from python module:
		python -m pythonscript ./path/to/module/module.python
